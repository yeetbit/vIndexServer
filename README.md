# vIndex_Server

- the server implementation of the wine inventory app.
- status: On hold

When I learned arrays mid 2019 I started writing this in Javascript. As some sort of local database implementation app. Without having any knowledge about how a database works, what key value pairs are, how to make good use of objects, how to use libraries in javascript.... Eventually ran into a bug which I couldn't fix. 

At some point during the course programming in Java: I was confronted with SQL and figured that I could get my feet wet on an actual server side implementation of vIndex.
