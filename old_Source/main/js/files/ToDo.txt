ToDo:
        main viewport function
        function for storage in JSON database 
        app build as PWA(progressive_web_application)
        Responsive design, 80% mobile 20% PC
        "Show in tiles" function(hand in hand with design)
        drop down options menu
        login


future improvements:

        -added functionality UICTRL.idrange
                momentalily the algorithm scans only the last object in the array,
                but for more accuracy if there is a possibility that no conditions are met,
                then scan al rows for the last ID. Eventualy is this maybe a better solution.
